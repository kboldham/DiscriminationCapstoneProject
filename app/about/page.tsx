      <h1>About Us</h1>
      
      <p>Our focus is on providing the people of Durham, NC with the resources to combat discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. To that end, we have built a safe platform to empower individuals to identify, document, and take action against the discriminatory practices that occur in their communities.</p>
      
      <p>We are creating a user-friendly application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to support individuals who are reporting discrimination. The user will be able to document their discrimination case and receive next steps based on their specific circumstances. We have made the process simple to help ease the complexity and stress associated with reporting discrimination.</p>
      
      <p>Along with providing assistance at the individual level, we are also committed to educating the community. We will present our prototype to community leaders and local government officials, demonstrating the reality of the problems occurring in Durham. Our goal is to foster collaboration and innovation by creating accountability, transparency, and real change.</p>
